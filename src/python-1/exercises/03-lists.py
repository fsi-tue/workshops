# Goal: Understand how to uses lists


# E1:
# Print the last element of list l1
l1 = ["first", "middle", "last"]


# E2:
# Print every second element of list l2.
# Without loop.
l2 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]


# E3:
# Print the list l3 in reverse.
# Without loop.
l3 = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]


# E4
# Print the element 4 to 8 in reverse order
l4 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]


# E5
# Add the number 5 to l4.


# E6
# Add the content of l4 to l6
l6 = ["A", "B", "C"]
