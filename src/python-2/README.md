Python Basics: Batteries included! üîãüîãüîã
=========================================

_Author(s): timfi (SS22)_

This is a 2.5-3h exploration of the python standard library
in a workshop format. The core idea is to demonstrate the
both the depth and breath of the pythons batteries to the
participants. To achieve this the workshop uses the
[Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev) as a running example.

How to workshop
---------------

This workshop is split in to 3 (4 if you're fast) parts:

1. the introduction
2. data acquisition
3. data munging and exploration
4. building a CLI

The 3 latter segments have for easier and maybe even cleaner
counter parts in the python ecosystem, but the standard
library can do quite a bit on its own. They are built up as
follows:

1. Introduce the general segment, i.e. what is data
   acquisition and its possible technologies.
2. Do the segments exercises as follows:
   1. Introduce the exercise as a high level task.
      > **‚è∞ This should take at most  5 minutes!**
   2. Introduce the required libraries and read through
      their documentation together with the participants.
      > **‚è∞ This should take at most 10 minutes!**
   3. Show the template and let the participants play with
      the problem a bit.
      > **‚è∞ This should take at most 10 minutes!**
   4. Demonstrate how *you* would have done it; or at least
      how the provided solutions do it.
      > **‚è∞ This should take at most 10 minutes!**

**‚ö† Each exercise should take at most 35 minutes!**

How to slides?!
---------------

The slides are built as a single markdown file which is
intended for use with [lookatme](https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/). But you can also
render them to HTML using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
If you are to lazy to lookup the proper options for either
just use the provided `Makefile`‚Ä¶
